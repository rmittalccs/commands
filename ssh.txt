SSH TO A SERVER WITHOUT HAVING TO ENTER A PASSWORD:
1.
on local machine:

If ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub does not exist:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

2.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-machine

if ssh-copy-id command not found
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@server:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

[Keep in mind that will overwrite ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server if you already have it.]

3.
chmod 600 authorized_keys or chmod o-r


AIFA:
ssh -t gate1 -e 'ssh aibn208'

CREATING hst_dsa

1. ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/hst_dsa

(this prompts you to enter a passphrase)

2. mkdir ~/.tcsh

   cp start_agent.csh ~/.tcsh
   (I got the .csh file from John)

   cd ~/.tcsh

   source start_agent.csh

   ssh-add ~/.ssh/hst_dsa
   (this asks for THE passphrase again)

3. Add the following in .cshrc
   source ~/.tcsh/start_agent.csh

4. mkdir ~/git

   cd git

   git clone gitosis@orcus.ccrg.rit.edu:HSTBCG
