    theme(text = element_text(family = "Karla"),
          legend.position = "none")


### To get RStudio to recognize the Karla fonts installed on your Mac, you can follow these steps
#################################################################################################

1. Install and Load Necessary Packages

You’ll need the extrafont and showtext packages to ensure that RStudio can access the installed fonts.
```
install.packages("extrafont")
install.packages("showtext")
library(extrafont)
library(showtext)
```

2. Import Fonts with extrafont

Run the following command to import the system fonts into R, which includes any newly installed fonts like Karla.

```
font_import(prompt = FALSE)
```

This might take a few minutes as it scans all available fonts. You can set prompt = FALSE to avoid being prompted for each font found.

3. Check if Karla is Available

After importing, check if the Karla fonts are available by listing the fonts.

```
fonts <- fonttable()
print(subset(fonts, grepl("Karla", FamilyName)))
```

This will list any Karla fonts that R recognizes. Ensure that "Karla Medium" or other Karla variants are included.

4. Use showtext to Load Fonts

The showtext package can help in rendering text using fonts that might not be directly accessible in RStudio's default graphics device. Add the Karla font to showtext:

```
font_add("Karla", "/Library/Fonts/Karla-Medium.ttf")
```

Adjust the path if necessary, depending on where the font is installed. The typical path on Mac is /Library/Fonts/ or ~/Library/Fonts/.

Automatically enable showtext:

```
showtext_auto()
```

5. Use Karla in Your Plots

Now, you can use the Karla font in your plots:

```
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Karla"))
```

6. Restart RStudio

If the font still isn't recognized, try restarting RStudio to ensure that all changes take effect.
Troubleshooting

    Font Conflicts: Sometimes, different versions of the same font (e.g., Karla) might cause conflicts. Ensure you’re using the correct and latest version.
    RStudio Version: Make sure RStudio is updated to the latest version, as older versions may have issues with font recognition.

By following these steps, RStudio should be able to recognize and use the Karla fonts you installed on your Mac.
