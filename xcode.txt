=======================================================
Xcode comes with LLVM and Clang, which you can use to compile C code.

Choosing Xcode > Open Developer Tool > More Developer Tools in Xcode
will take you to Apple's developer downloads site, where you can
download the Command Line Tools for Xcode package. Make sure you
download the package that matches your Xcode and OS X versions, as
there are separate versions for Yosemite and Mavericks and separate
versions for Xcode 6.1.1 and Xcode 6.1.

-> I did that and downloaded Command Line Tools (OS X 10.9) Xcode -
   Xcode 6.2

This package enables UNIX-style development via Terminal by installing
command line developer tools, as well as Mac OS X SDK frameworks and
headers. Many useful tools are included, such as the Apple LLVM
compiler, linker, and Make. If you use Xcode, these tools are also
embedded within the Xcode IDE.
