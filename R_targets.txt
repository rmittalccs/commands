list(
  tar_target(watch_new_data, "data/new_data.rda", format = "file"),
  tar_target(use_new_data, read_from_path(watch_new_data))
)
```
where read_from_path() is a function that takes a file path as its argument, and returns the associated object:

```
read_from_path <- function (path) {
  envir <- environment()
  data_name <- load(path, envir = envir)
  get(data_name)
}
```
