Tweaking Max Block Length and Block Length Interval

Read this closely. If you do it wrong, SelfControl will not launch.

To adjust the maximum block time and interval on the sliders, just open Terminal.app in Applications --> Utilities, then enter the following two commands (substituting the words in brackets with numbers). Press enter after each line:

defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl MaxBlockLength -int [maximum block length in minutes]
defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl BlockLengthInterval -int [block length interval in minutes]

So, for example, to change it to a month-long maximum block with intervals at each day, you could use:

defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl MaxBlockLength -int 43200
defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl BlockLengthInterval -int 1440

If you mess something up, use this Terminal command (while SelfControl is closed) to reset these settings:

defaults delete org.eyebeam.SelfControl
