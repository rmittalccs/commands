pdftk:
1. brew tap docmunch/pdftk
2. brew install pdftk

gnuplot:
- brew install gnuplot -> gnuplot was not supporting x11 even after I
installed XQuartz
- The following trick worked:
brew uninstall gnuplot; brew install gnuplot --with-x11 --wx --cairo --pdf --with-x --tutorial

Warning: gnuplot: --with-x was deprecated; using --with-x11 instead!
Warning: gnuplot: --pdf was deprecated; using --with-pdflib-lite instead!
Warning: gnuplot: --wx was deprecated; using --with-wxmac instead!
Warning: gnuplot: --cairo was deprecated; using --with-cairo instead!

------------------------------

I had to do the following so that brew installed things properly without giving the message

---------------------
Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
Could not symlink bin/jbig2dec
/usr/local/bin is not writable.

sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /usr/local
sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /Library/Caches/Homebrew
