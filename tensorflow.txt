outputs.eval(session=tf.compat.v1.Session())

If in eagerly mode, then the following syntax is will print out the
tensor

"None when executing eagerly. During graph tracing this returns a TF
operator that prints the specified inputs in the specified output
stream or logging level. This operator will be automatically executed
except inside of tf.compat.v1 graphs and sessions."


Eagerly
#######

tf.executing_eagerly()
>>> True / False

"Run this tf.enable_eager_execution() and then when you try
tf.executing_eagerly() it should give True. After this you can use
something.numpy() to view the values."

"I've found that my issue clears up after inserting
tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() at the top of my script (very
similar to what previous posters have said, but this works for TF
2.0).."
