Why this name, Keras?
#####################

Keras (κέρας) means horn in Greek. It is a reference to a literary
image from ancient Greek and Latin literature, first found in the
Odyssey, where dream spirits (Oneiroi, singular Oneiros) are divided
between those who deceive dreamers with false visions, who arrive to
Earth through a gate of ivory, and those who announce a future that
will come to pass, who arrive through a gate of horn. It's a play on
the words κέρας (horn) / κραίνω (fulfill), and ἐλέφας (ivory) /
ἐλεφαίρομαι (deceive).

Keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of
project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot
Operating System).

"Oneiroi are beyond our unravelling - who can be sure what tale they
tell? Not all that men look for comes to pass. Two gates there are
that give passage to fleeting Oneiroi; one is made of horn, one of
ivory. The Oneiroi that pass through sawn ivory are deceitful, bearing
a message that will not be fulfilled; those that come out through
polished horn have truth behind them, to be accomplished for men who
see them." Homer, Odyssey 19. 562 ff (Shewring translation).
